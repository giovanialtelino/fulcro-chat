# fulcro-chat
Clojure Fulcro Chat Room using Kafka as only state.

## Kafka

I assume you are familiar with Kafka, while this project was built to use it, you should be fine to adapt it to use
 any other kind of message stream processors like RabbitMQ or AWS Kinesis.
 
## Fulcro

Fulcro is pretty much a Clojure Full Stack Framework built with Transit, Om, Ring, React and some other Clojure stuff.

## Why

Because why not? Wanted to test Fulcro and Kafka is something kinda practical. A big chat room like the old days of
 the internet, which I didn't participate so much, appeared to be a good idea.
 
#Observations

Once this project finish I should update my blog with some observations and thoughts I had during the process
. For now wait a little, and feel free to push, pull and clone it as you wish, MIT Licensed.
